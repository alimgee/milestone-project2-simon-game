SIMON ONLINE
</h2>

<div align="center"> 

SIMON was a popular memory game in the 80s and still retains its appeal today. This is an online version of the game. Its basic premise is that the user must replicate the pattern of lights that the computer outputs, the pattern increase by 1 each round the user progresses. In this version of the game, to win on normal setting requireds that you replicate the computers selection for 10 consecutive rounds, if that's too easy you can set the difficulty level to hard and go all out for 20 rounds.

This is project is part of the 'Interactive Front-end Milestone 2' module of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course. The marks from this project contribute to the receipt of a diploma level award.

## UX

### Project Goals

The goal of this project from a developer learning perspetive is to utilize the understanding of interactive front-end using javascript gained during completing this section of the course.

The user end goal is to create a version of the Simon game online, that the user can interact with in a similar manner as the original game.

#### User goals

The aim is to create a simple memory game that is fun and simple to use and is made easier to complete successfully using a difficulty setting.

#### User Stories
1. When i come to the site i want the game board to be clearly displayed
2. I want to be able to select a hard or easy difficult level each time i play the game
3. I want the play button to be clearly labeled
4. I want to see my progress through the game displayed and for it to be clear if i have won or lost
5. The colour pads should be a similar colour to the original game and should make a sound to acknowledge a click
6. The computer selections should also make a sound when each pad lights up to make the memorization task a little easier
7. I would like to view a brief history of the game and also it would be helpful to have the the game rules visible if required

### Design
For the design I decided to keep it as clean and simple as possible. Initially i was using a a background image from the 80s movie 'Tron' to maintain an 80s feel but felt as the project progressed that the background image made the game a little cluttered looking. The game pads have the same colours as the original adopting a similar black background. The design is fully responsive across multiple devices.

**Fonts**
I decided to use the 'Righteous' font from google("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Righteous") as i felt that this closely resembled the original game font.

**Colours**
I went with a dark nav look and light blue background (#45a29e) on the body as i thought they best complemented the game board.

**Topography**
The site uses bootstrap 4 to be fully responsive across multiple devices, also some media queries were used to change the game board size, display section size and font sizes across different devices to provide a smooth user experience.

**Audio files**
The following sound files were used to replicate the original game sounds:
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound1.mp3`, `https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound2.mp3`, `https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound3.mp3`, `https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound4.mp3`.
